<h1>Life is like locomotion.</h1>
<h2>If you're not moving, you're not living.</h2>
<h3>But there comes a time when you've got to stop running away from things, and you've got to start running towards something.</h3>
<h4>You've got to forge ahead.</h4>
<h5>Keep moving.</h5>
<h6>Even if the path isn't lit, trust you'll find your way.</h6>
